Platform: Adafruit PyPortal Titano
Project: Adafruit_DisplayIO_FlipClock with sercom_I2C
Version: 2
Script for device with role Main
IDE: mu-editor v 1.1.1

Note: The script is doing what it is meant to do:
 1) send a request for datetime to the device with role Sensor
 2) call ck_uart() to handle the acknowledge from the device with role Sensor
 3) ... idem ...   handle the received datetime
 4) set the built-in RTC with the received datetime
 5) call make_clock() to prepare the PyPortal Titano flipclock display
 6) set the flipclock four digits: two digits (hours) for the 'first pair' and two digits (minutes) for the 'second pair'
 7) at a minute interval update the flipclock
 8) if necessary (at certain interval time) set the built-in RTC to the fresh NTP datetime;
 9) do some datetime conversion if necessary;
10) continue to loop inside main().

Note: below two run's of the script.
      1) with global boolean flag 'use_dynamic_fading' = False 
	  2) with global boolean flag 'use_dynamic_fading' = True
	  
	  At the end I added a table with the differences in free memory during these two runs.
