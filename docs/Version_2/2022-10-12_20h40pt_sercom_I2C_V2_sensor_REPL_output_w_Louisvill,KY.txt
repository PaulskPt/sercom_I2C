Script for device with role Sensor
IDE: mu-editor v 1.1.1

Note: The script is doing what it is meant to do:
 1) wait for a request for datetime from the device with role Main
 2) when a request is received the device with the role Sensor will answer the receipt with sending an ACK ascii code to the device from which it received the request
 2) Next gets an updated datetime thru the adafruit_ntp module
 3) converts the received time.struct_time into a string of format: 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm_ss'
 4) adds the address of the device with role Main in front of the message to me send as byte #0
 5) then adds the length of the datetime string as byte #1
 6) adds a STX ascii code as byte #2 into the message.
 7) adds the converted datetime string to the message.
 8) continues to loop inside loop().
